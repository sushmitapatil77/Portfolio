Portfolio:

1. Create the index.html document first with all the basic content like nav bar, social icons, footer with copyright. 
2. Then comes styling. We are using Sass for this project(mainly SCSS).
	1. Create a folder called "scss". 
	2. create a file in this folder called "main.scss".  
	3. create another file called "_config.scss" which will be the partial. 
		We are going to create partials for all of our elements. 
		Thats what they do in larger projects. 
	4. created a home and menu partials too.
3. For styling the menu burger icon, we have styled one bar and used pseudo elements to create the top and bottom bars.
